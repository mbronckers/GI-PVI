# Have manually verified the below during debugging, but it would be good to write an integration test for this.

# TODO: write test to verify the correct updating of values in variables

# Init data
# Create clients
# Create client-local optimizer
# Run optimization
# Check values are equal to optimizer values; (note nz in optim is the unconstrained version of nz in client, i.e. check that the unconstrained version is equal to the latent variable in vs)
